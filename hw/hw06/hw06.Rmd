### Instructions 
* Solutions will be released on Sunday, October 13th. 
* This semester, problem sets are for practice only and will not be turned in for marks.

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration!

- To avoid code running off the page, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the file. If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

Oklahoma is not historically known for experiencing earthquakes. Up until 
2008, Oklahoma experienced a constant rate of about 1.5 perceptible earthquakes
per year on average.

**1. [1 point] Assuming that earthquakes are random and independent, with a constant rate of 1.5 per year, the count of perceptible earthquakes per year in Oklahoma should have a Poisson distribution with mean 1.5. What is the standard deviation of the number of earthquakes per year? Round to 3 decimal places.**

```{r}
sd_earthquake <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
sd_earthquake


# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p1.R")
```

\newpage

**2. [1 point] Using the same assumptions from part (a), use one or two R functions to compute the probability of seeing less than two earthquakes per year. Round your answer to three decimal places.**

```{r}
probability <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
probability


# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p2.R")
```

\newpage

**3. Repeat the same calculation as above, this time using only a scientific calculator. Show your work and round your final percentage to two decimal places.**

\newpage

**4. In 2013, Oklahoma experienced 109 perceptible earthquakes (an average of two per week). Assuming the same model as above, write an equation to show how the chance of experiencing 109 earthquakes or more can be written as a function of the probability at or below some $k$.**

(Note: You can write these equations using pen and paper and upload the image if
you'd like. You can also write the equations using plain text (i.e., P(X >= k)).
If you would like to use math equations that render when you knit the pdf 
(i.e., $P(X>=k)$) you need to be **very careful** with your symbols. For example, to get the symbol for "greater than or equal to" you cannot copy and paste it into R from the slides or another document. This will cause errors! Instead you need to
write $P(X \geq k)$. 

<Note: If you are uploading an image (this is optional), use the following code, or delete if not using. BE SURE TO REMOVE THE OPTION "eval = F" if using this code OR IT WON'T RUN when you knit the file!>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)
# include_graphics("your-scans-name.jpg")
# After uploading the file to datahub's Image sub-directory, change the above line with your file's name and execute the line of code.
# Verify that the image is printed below the code chunk.

\newpage

**7. Based on your answer to question 5, would you conclude that the mean number of perceptible earthquakes has increased? Why or why not? Would knowing that the number of perceptible earthquakes was 585 in 2014 support your conclusion?**

To track epidemics, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention requires 
physicians to report all cases of important transmissible diseases. In 2014,
a total of 350,062 cases of gonorrhea were officially reported, 53% of whom 
were individuals in their 20s. Assume this 53% stays the same every year.
Researchers plan to take a simple random sample of 400 diagnosed cases of 
gonorrhea to study the risk factors associated with the disease. Call $\hat{p}$
the proportion of cases in the sample corresponding to individuals in their 20s. 

**8. [1 point] What is the mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ in random samples of size 400?**

```{r}
sampling_dist_mean <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
sampling_dist_mean


# YOUR CODE HERE

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p8.R")

\newpage

**9. [1 point] What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ in random samples of size 400? Round your answer to 3 decimal places.**

```{r}
sampling_dist_sd <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p9.R")

Read [this short article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/upshot/when-you-hear-the-margin-of-error-is-plus-or-minus-3-percent-think-7-instead.html)
in the New York Times Upshot from 2016. (All Berkeley students should have access to a free NY Times subscription.)

**11. Explain sampling variation in the context of this article. Does the 3 percentage point margin of error account for sampling variation?**

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

\newpage

**12. The authors provide several reasons as to why the true margin of error is larger than three percent. Describe one of the primary reasons provided in 1-2 sentences.**

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

\newpage

**13. [1 point] Based on the information in the article, if we're doing a study in public health, choose the answer that is most correct:**

    (a) The confidence interval accounts for random error only. If a study suffers
    from other sources of bias (i.e., confounding, or mismeasurement) the CI will
    not account for this limitation.
    (b) Increasing the sample size will reduce the chance of other sources of bias
    (i.e., confounding, or mismeasurement), which is why a larger sample is better.
    (c) both (a) and (b)
    d) neither (a) or (b)

Assign your letter choice as a string. Example: nytimes_answer <- "c"

nytimes_answer <-  NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

Deer mice are small rodents native in North America. Their adult body lengths (excluding their tails) are known to vary approximately Normally, with mean $\mu=86$ mm and standard deviation $\sigma=8$ mm. It is suspected that depending on their  environment, deer mice may adapt and deviate from these usual lengths. A random  sample of $n=14$ deer mice in a rich forest habitat gives an average body length of $\bar{x}=91.1$ mm. Assume that the standard deviation $\sigma$ of all deer mice in this area is 8 mm. 

**14. [1 point] Calculate a 99% confidence interval based on this information (you can use R as a calculator to perform the calculation, or use a scientific calculator). Round your final values to three decimal places.**

```{r}
lower_tail <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
upper_tail <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
ci_99 <- c(lower_tail, upper_tail)

ci_99

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

\newpage

**17. [1 point] You decide to calculate a 95% confidence interval rather than use the 99% confidence interval you just calculated. Perform this calculation below and round your answer to 3 decimal places.**

lower_tail95 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
upper_tail95 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
ci_95 <- c(lower_tail95, upper_tail95)

\newpage

**18. Based on this 95% CI, is there evidence against the null hypothesis, $H_0$, that these mice have a significantly different mean length compared to the population described in the first part of the question? Without performing a calculation, what is the range of values for this p-value in a two-sided hypothesis test of $H_0$?**

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

After a vaccine is created for SARS-CoV-2, the next important step would be understanding how many Americans will actually get the vaccine.

**23. Suppose we want to estimate the proportion of Americans who would get the vaccine if it were available. We interview a random sample of 100 Americans about whether they would choose to be vaccinated if it were an option. Unknown to us, the true population proportion who would be vaccinated is 0.50. What is the expected value and the standard error of the sample proportion?**

Note: This sample proportion is only an estimate but reflects the proportion of Americans willing to accept the hypothetical vaccine in a recent study.

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

**24. Which of the following is an appropriate statement of the central limit theorem? Select just one.**

  (1) The central limit theorem states that if you take a large random sample from a population and the data in the population are normally distributed, the data in your sample will be normally distributed.
  
  (2) The central limit theorem states that if you take a large random sample from a population, the data in your sample will be normally distributed.
 
  (3) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population and the data in the population are normally distributed, the sample means will be normally distributed.
  
  (4) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population, the sample means will be normally distributed.
 
  (5) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population and the data in the population are normally distributed, the data from the pooled samples will be normally distributed.
  
  (6) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population, the data from the pooled samples will be normally distributed.
