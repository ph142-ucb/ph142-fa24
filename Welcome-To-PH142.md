Welcome to PH 142: Introduction to Probability and Statistics in Biology and Public Health!

<hr>

More specifically, welcome to your very own Datahub server! Datahub is a computational 
environment that students and faculty can use for learning and research purposes without 
the hassle of running these programs locally on your own machine. In other words, it's 
essentially your own server to do computational work on.

In Public Health 142, we will be using the Public Health hub to supplement our 
understanding of statistics. What you see on your screen right now is the 
RStudios interface, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to code in R. If you're
not too sure what that is, don't worry -- we'll be covering it in the first lab.

As the semester progresses, we (Paula) will be updating the assignments (assignments, labs, projects, 
etc), which will show up in your Datahub. It will be your responsibility to get these updates by 
**clicking on any of the Datahub/assignment links on the course website**. If an assignment isn't 
showing up in your server, you most likely didn't click on one of links.

We hope that by the end of the semester, you come out with a fresh, new (hopefully positive) perspective 
towards probability & statistics, and that you come to appreciate its importance in real-life application 
towards public health. As always, if you ever need support or help (or just need someone to talk to about 
the class), you can take advantage of any of the following resources:
- Piazza
- Office Hours
- Emailing ph142@berkeley.edu

Looking forward to the semester we have together,
Your PH 142 Teaching Staff~
