This lab goes through an ANOVA hypothesis test then checking the pairwise significance using Tukey's HSD.

To Do:

1. Update due date with the due date from the syllabus.
2. Update submission instructions at the bottom of the assignment to reflect fa50.
3. Comment out the line in the setup code chunk that states `source("setup/lab09.RAGS.R")` and add a line that states `source("lab09.RAGS-hidden.R")`
4. Open lab09.RAGS-hidden.R and replace the line that states `source("setup/autograder_setup.R")` with `source(../common/setup/autograder_setup.R")`
5. Go through and check the autograder. Replace error messages with more informative messages if necessary.
6. Return to lab09-sol.Rmd and read through for spelling, grammar, and clarity. If you have a question, please ask!
7. Run the `total_score()` code at the bottom and be sure you pass all checkpoints.
8. Knit the file.
9. Delete `source("lab09.RAGS-hidden.R")` and uncomment `source("setup/lab09.RAGS.R")`.
10. Return to the RAGS file and comment out `source(../common/setup/autograder_setup.R")` and uncomment `source("setup/autograder_setup.R")`
11. Create a branch and start a pull request. Assign Sophie and Corinne as Reviewers. Ping us on Slack once you have completed the previous tasks.
